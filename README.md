A Simple Python Todo List. Here are the commands
* complete (c) - Finish an item on your todo list
* add (a) - Add an item to the bottom of your todo list
* move (m) - Move an item on your todo list
* list (l) - List all of the things on your todo list

A tiny project for myself, used to try out TDD. Definitely a learning experience!
